## Project Description

Savannah Budget App is a project forked from [Open Austin](https://github.com/openaustin) that was built to help people understand and augment a city budget for Savannah. It is an interactive app that is best used in context of a "Budget Party" event. Upon balancing the budget successfully, users may choose whether to submit their budget for feedback to the City's Department of Budget Management.



- **A budget Overview.** A quick presentation is given to people that primes them on the city budget, specifically the parts that citizens can influence.  

- **Budget Party App Use.** People get into small teams with neighbors to go through the app and allocate funds to different departments. 

- **Judging** A selection of people with real city budgeting experience judge the submitted budgets and choose a winner based on the nightâ€™s criteria. 

- **Panel Discussion** Once judging is done there is an open discussion on budgeting based on the submitted budgets, feasibility, and real world budgeting experience from the panelist/judges. 

**Got an idea?** Community feedback is valuable in helping us evaluate our next steps. How can we make Budget Party more valuable for you?
