Thanks for coming here to learn more!

## Project Description

Budget Party was built to help people understand and augment a city budget for Savannah. It is an interactive app that is best used in context of a "Budget Party" event. 

Budget party events have 4 parts:

- **A budget Overview.** A quick presentation is given to people that primes them on the city budget, specifically the parts that citizens can influence.  

- **Budget Party App Use.** People get into small teams with neighbors to go through the app and allocate funds to different departments. 

- **Judging** A selection of people with real city budgeting experience judge the submitted budgets and choose a winner based on the night‚Äôs criteria. 

- **Panel Discussion** Once judging is done there is an open discussion on budgeting based on the submitted budgets, feasibility, and real world budgeting experience from the panelist/judges. 

## What's Next

The Budget Party team is currently on pause. Budget season in Austin is over for 2017 but we are working to evaluate how best to move forward with the project to be ready for the 2018 budget season. 

**Got an idea?** Community feedback is valuable in helping us evaluate our next steps. How can we make Budget Party more valuable for you?
