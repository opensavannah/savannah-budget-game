# Contributing to Budget Party

:+1: :tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada: :+1:

This project has received contributions from some wonderful volunteers. Our goal is to make it easy for you to jump in and help.

## What should I know before I get started?

### Code of Conduct
This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant [code of conduct](CONTRIBUTING.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to info {at} open-austin {dot} org.

### README
Our [README](README.md) is the first place you should go, if you haven't already. If you have questions about the goals or purpose of the project, we'd be happy to clarify. [Create an issue](https://github.com/open-austin/budgetparty/issues/new) and mark it with the "question" label.

### Roadmap
Our [roadmap](README.md/#roadmap) is written to give you an idea of the current status of the project. Check it out to see what we are planning to include in the next release and if there are any target dates for upcoming releases.

### Communication
We communicate in a couple different ways:
 1. Github -  You can [open an issue](https://github.com/open-austin/budgetparty/issues/new) to start a discussion here within Github. The project leads will get an email with your message and we will do our best to respond promptly.
 2. Slack - [Invite yourself](https://slack.open-austin.org/) to the Open Austin Slack Channel and join the [#budgetparty channel](https://open-austin.slack.com/messages/budgetparty).
 3. IRL - Come to an Open Austin Civic Hack Night and let's chat in person.

## How can I help?

Over the course of this project, we will have (or have had) opportunities to help with design, development, QA & testing, writing, and more. To contribute, you can:

- Report a bug or request a feature by opening a new issue.
- Review [open issues](https://github.com/open-austin/budgetparty/issues) and leave a comment if you'd like to help or if you need more information.

### Design

Here is a link to our [design assets and documentation](./design). Here are [open issues labeled "Design"](https://github.com/open-austin/hack-the-budget/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Adesign) where you can discuss, provide feedback or volunteer to help.

### Development
The Budget Party app is primarily written in javascript and leans heavily into the libraries [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Redux](http://redux.js.org/). The static assets are hosted via [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/). Data submitted to the server lives in a [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/), a Google cloud service.

[Issues marked with the code label](stin/budgetparty/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Acode) are bugs or features that require some knowledge of CSS, React, Javascript, or Firebase.

Issues with the help wanted label indicate where the best place to start are, but contributions are welcome on any open issue. Please leave a comment before you start working in case work is underway from another contributor.


### Curriculum
An awesome teacher at Lanier High School, Laurie Beaman, laurie.beaman@austinisd.org, designed and wrote a Curriculum Binder for teaching high schoolers about the City Budget. Check it out here:
[Budget Game Binder PDF](https://github.com/open-austin/budgetparty/files/1009706/Budget.Game.Binder.pdf)

We'd like to convert this PDF document into HTML to make it accessible for more educators to view and use. If you're interested in helping with this task, check out [this issue](https://github.com/open-austin/budgetparty/issues/128) and let's chat!
